# My todos
My version of [gaeron's todos](https://github.com/gaearon/todos.git) with React and Redux.

Applies what I learned from [gaeron's Redux guides](https://egghead.io/courses/building-react-applications-with-idiomatic-redux).

Includes a real API server with express and MongoDB.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
